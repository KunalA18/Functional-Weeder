  Creates a stream that will apply the given function on enumeration in
  parallel and only pass the values for which the function returns truthy
  downstream.

  ## Options

  These are the options:

    * `:num_workers`   – The number of parallel operations to run when running the stream.
    * `:worker_work_ratio` – The available work per worker, defaults to 5. Higher rates will mean more work sharing, but might also lead to work fragmentation slowing down the queues.

  ## Examples

  Map and filter the even numbers:

      iex> parallel_stream = 1..5 |> ParallelStream.filter(fn i -> i |> rem(2) == 0 end)
      iex> parallel_stream |> Enum.to_list
