  Functional Weeder

## üóíÔ∏è Problem Statement
This theme is in response to the agricultural scenario where labor-intensive work is prevalent. Multiple autonomous robots explore an arena and communicate with one another to perform tasks simultaneously. The robots are programmed using Elixir language with a dashboard logging the sequence of events and remaining tasks in real-time over the Internet.

The arena abstracts a farm, consisting of crop seeds to be planted and weeds to be removed. Crop seeds that must be sowed and weeds to be removed from the farm are present in the arena; necessary actions are taken by two or more robots. These robots work collaboratively and communicate with each other to explore the unknown farm and determine where seeds should be sown and/or weeds should be removed. If one of the robots fail, the residual task may be taken over by another. The team that completes tasks in the shortest amount of time with minimum penalties wins.
